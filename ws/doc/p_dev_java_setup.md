Set Up Your Development Environment
===================================

**Note:** To use the Gateway, a KAAZING client library, or a KAAZING demo, fork the repository from [kaazing.org](http://kaazing.org).

In this procedure, you will learn how to configure the development environment for a Kaazing Java client.

Before You Begin
----------------

This procedure is part of [Build Java WebSocket Clients](o_dev_java.md):

1.  **Set Up Your Development Environment**
2.  [Use the Java WebSocket API](p_dev_java_websocket.md)
3.  [Use the Java EventSource API](p_dev_java_eventsource.md)
4.  [Migrate WebSocket and ByteSocket Applications to KAAZING Gateway 5.0](p_dev_java_migrate.md)
5.  [Secure Your Java and Android Clients](p_dev_java_secure.md)
6.  [Display Logs for the Java Client](p_dev_java_logging.md)
7.  [Troubleshoot Your Java Client](p_dev_java_tshoot.md)

To Set Up Your Development Environment
--------------------------------------

1.  To use the Java client library in your Java client, you must include the library located in the JAR file  `org.kaazing.gateway.client.jar`. This JAR file is located in the KAAZING Gateway bundle in the directory `GATEWAY_HOME/lib/client/java`.
2.  Refer to the Java documentation for more information on how to package external code in your Java client.
